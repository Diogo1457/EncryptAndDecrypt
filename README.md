## Program Description:                       

### This program encrypts and decrypt files  
or strings with passwords.				  
                                         
### It allows creating local users where it  
stores encrypted logs (using your main     
password).								  
										  
### The logs store the passwords that you   
used to encrypt data. All logs are         
encrypted and you can find them on the     
logs folder created in the same folder     
that you placed this program. 			  
										  
### If you forget some file or string        
encryption password you can check it in    
your user logs.                            
### Note: For keeping logs you need to be  
logged in with the user you want to save   
that log.								  
										  
### You can update your username or          
password. You can also delete it.         
										  
### You can also encrypt or decrypt files    
without saving the logs (if you forget     
the password used to encrypt the file or   
string you can't recover it).
